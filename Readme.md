*******************RDF SPARRQL Visualization**************************

GETTING STARTED

In order to run the tool, Python environment is the first requisite. 
Once Python is set up, check out the requirements.txt file. 
Using any Python package installer, download and install the list of packages that are mentioned in the requirements.txt. 
After the packages are installed, launch the python terminal. 
Run the command: python app.py
This shall run the main file and a localhost link shall get displayed. 
Click on the localhost link to launch the tool dashboard. 


USING THE DASHBOARD

You can view the dashbaord in the localhost link. 
By default, the dashboard has no input data. 
Begin by uploading a file in RDF format. 
Once the file is uploaded, you can see the filename displayed. 

Next the user can start by either running the default sparql query which retreives all data from the graph or search for a
subject or predicate from the search box at the bottom. 

There is a Generate Graph button that generates the graph on the dashboard and a Clear graph button that resets the graph and lets the user start exploring again. 
The dashboard offers zoom in, zoom out functionality also. 

To understand the graph better, users can drag and drop the nodes on the screen. There is also a button that resets these fixed nodes.  

Both the search and sparql capabilities with a file in RDF format give this tool an edge over others.
